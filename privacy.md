# User Data and Privacy

ARTWO requires the use of your phone Camera to run Augmented Reality. No images are captured or transmitted from your device. ARTWO offers the option of taking in-app screnshots, and these are stored locally on your device in the Android Data folder.

As ARTWO is part of an academic research project, it logs anonymous usage data of the time spent on various parts of this app. This information is only available to the project team (Rishi Vanukuru and Prof. Jayesh Pillai), and will be destroyed upon project completion (by December 2020).

Player data, such as AR Phone name and Game High Scores, are stored locally on your device and not transmitted. You can clear this data in the About section on the start page.
