My name is Rishi, and I'm a second year Master's student in Interaction Design at the IDC School of Design, IIT Bombay.

My research interests are in the areas of Accessibility and HCI [[1]](/projects/nonvisualinterfaces), and designing for Augmented and Virtual Reality experiences [[2]](/projects/creativityvr) [[3]](/projects/musicvr). You can read more about my work in the [Projects section](/projects/).

Before joining the IDC, I was an undergraduate student at IIT Bombay (2014 - 2018), where I majored in Civil Engineering with a minor degree in Design.
